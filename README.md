Code labs  for Prometheus

This repository contains "code labs" for Prometheus. Basically a
sequence of guided experimentation to get familiarity with Prometehus,
its query language and general configuration.

Each code lab is in a subdirectory named "codelab_N_", with a README
file containing the lab description.

Each code lab is expected to use a prometehus instance wired up to
scrape the metrics-generator (in the `metrics-generator/` subdirectory).
